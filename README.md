Following a computer science tradition of getting started

Hi there,
This is Santosh, a seasoned Java developer and a Quantitative Analyst. 

Contributing to open source projects has been on my wish list for a long time. I am glad I am finally getting started with it. My goal for this year is to made some significant contributions to help the open source community and payback a part of all the help I have ussed from the community so far. Next year, I want to see my status changed from "just started on open source" to "open source contributor with sizable number of commits".
